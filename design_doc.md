✅ **Performance Optimizations**:
- Dataset streaming support (HDF5 batching, multi-threaded)
- TorchScript export with static input sizes for fast inference
- Optional TensorRT conversion
- Lightweight models for edge AI devices

✅ **Multi-Task Model Integration**:
- A single CNN backbone with multi-head outputs for:
    - Modulation classification
    - Binary jamming detection
    - Jamming type classification (if jammed)

✅ **Evaluation + Debugging Utilities**:
- Console-based reporting with accuracy, F1-score
- Model confidence visualization
- Confusion matrices
- Test-time augmentation options

Milestones:
-----------
1. **Directory Generator Script** (Stage 1)
   - Creates optimized project scaffold
   - Copies/cleans up existing training and inference scripts
   - Documents purpose of each module in README.md

2. **Training Framework Refactor** (Stage 2)
   - Modular `ModulationJammingDataset`
   - Generalized `MultiTaskCNN` model
   - Unified `train.py` with CLI and config support

3. **Signal Generation Toolkit** (Stage 3)
   - Standard GRC flowgraph templates
   - Parametrized RF signal generation CLI
   - Optional jamming injectors

4. **Deployment Pipeline** (Stage 4)
   - TorchScript export (already working)
   - TensorRT engine builder
   - Jetson-ready inference script

5. **GNU Radio Integration** (Stage 5)
   - Custom Python block template
   - Live inference from SDR or signal source
   - Compatible with headless Jetson Nano

Future Expansion:
-----------------
- Support for automatic dataset labeling via GNU Radio + metadata tags
- UI dashboard for dataset visualization and management
- Model registry + experiment tracking (e.g., with Weights & Biases or MLflow)
- Beamforming + jamming spatial simulation module

Conclusion:
-----------
This suite aims to be the foundation of a complete **RFML research and deployment stack**, from signal synthesis to live hardware inference. The goal is not just a proof-of-concept, but a **production-grade framework** adaptable for academic research, defense simulation, and wireless AI exploration.
